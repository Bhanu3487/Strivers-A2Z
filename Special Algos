// Moore voting algorithm / Boyer-Moore Majority Vote - majority element

// Tortoise and Hare - 2 pts ptng to head, 1st ptr inc by 1, 2nd ptr inc by 2 in loop
//                   - used in LL: detect a cycle, find middle element

// Dummy Variable - a new node pointing to head, used when we need to create a new ll
                  - 

// Kadane's algorithm - maxsubrray

// sliding window- in 2ptr when asked for the max of something, we slide (i.e inc r and dec l) while maintaining the len since we want max len (it either remains same or inc)
// ex - 2ptr Q3 fruits in basket

// Kahn's algorithm - for toposort by using indegree arr and ordering

// graphs
// dijkstra's - shortest dist from a node to all other nodes- with no -ve cycles - time O(ElogV)
// bellman ford - shortest dist from a node to all other nodes- can detect -ve cycles - time O(V*E)
// Floyd Warshall Algorithm - shortest distance of all nodes from all nodes- can detect -ve cycles - O(V*E)
